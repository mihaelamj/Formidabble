# Formidabble

Formidabble is a Swift-based app for rendering and managing complex, hierarchical forms with ease. Designed with clarity, performance, and offline support in mind, it offers a delightful experience for collecting structured data across platforms. Build forms that are not just fillable â€” but formidabble.

## ðŸ§  Architecture Philosophy

Formidabble follows a **modular, scalable architecture** inspired by [merowingâ€™s posts](https://www.merowing.info/), with a clear separation of concerns from day one:

- **Workspace-driven structure**  
  Manual creation of `.xcworkspace` avoids entangling logic and UI with IDE-generated clutter.

- **Packages first, App last**  
  Code lives in Swift Packages inside the `Packages/` directory â€” the app target in `Apps/` is just a thin entry point, importing features from packages.

- **Clean boundaries**  
  Each package (e.g. `AppFeature`, `SharedModels`) has a single responsibility, tests, and no unnecessary dependencies.

- **Extreme Packaging**  
  Everything is wrapped tightly â€” even utility logic lives in separate targets when needed. This lets you swap, test, or isolate functionality effortlessly.

### ðŸ§± Example Layering

```
Apps/
â”œâ”€â”€ iOSApp/
â”‚	â””â”€â”€ FormidabbleMobileApp.swift â†’ imports AppFeature
â””â”€â”€ macOSApp/
    â””â”€â”€ FormidabbleDesktopApp.swift â†’ imports AppFeature   

Packages/
â”œâ”€â”€ AppFeature/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AppView.swift â†’ imports HomeFeature
â”œâ”€â”€ HomeFeature/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ HomeView.swift â†’ uses SharedModels
â”œâ”€â”€ SharedModels/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ QItem.swift, Enums.swift
```

> âœ…Â This approach makes the architecture future-proof, testable, and platform-agnostic from the start.

### ðŸ“¦ Project Setup Steps

#### 1. Clone the Base Structure

Begin by downloading the foundational structure from my [ExtremePackaging](https://github.com/mihaelamj/ExtremePackaging/tree/stage/01-init-packages) repository.

This provides a ready-to-go Swift Package layout with linting support:

```
.gitignore
.swiftformat
.swiftlint.yml
LICENSE
README.md
Packages/
Apps/
```

#### 2. Add Workspace

Create a new Xcode workspace manually in the root of the project (I call it `Main.xcworkspace`).  
Then add the `Packages` folder to the workspace.  
This integrates your package structure into the workspace.

#### 3. Add App Targets

Under the `Apps` directory, create new SwiftUI app targets using Xcode.  
Add these apps to the workspace. Each app target should only depend on the required feature modules from `Packages`.  
Examples:

- `FormidabbleDesktop`
- `FormidabbleMobile`

---

This setup allows all logic to live inside Swift packages, with the app targets serving as light entry points. You can easily test, scale, and replace modules without impacting the rest of the system.

- check for typos
- delete comment and obsolete debug code
